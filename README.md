taggy
=====

An attoparsec based html parser. 

Currently very WIP. It even chokes on some HTML, although it already supports a fairly decent range of common websites.

The performance is quite promising for now, but we don't do a lof of things that tagsoup does, like converting `&amp;` to `&`, etc.
